Failed to process full csv : No JSON object found in response.

Raw LLM response: <think>
Okay, I need to help correct this CSV data into a proper JSON array. Let's see, the user has provided a list of rows from a CSV file where some fields are missing or vague. My task is to fill in the missing fields using natural language hints and then standardize time fields to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. Also, I have to fix spelling or casing errors like "rb" should be corrected to "Rb" or "NRb". Oh, and ensure that each row has exactly these keys: ad_id, company_name, location, start_time, end_time, description, placement_on_device, rb_nrb, availability. The output needs to be a strict JSON array without any extra comments or escape characters.

First, I'll go through each row one by one and fill in the missing fields using the given hints. Let's take the first example:

The first row has " rb" as the placement on device. Since it says "Rb/NRb", but places are either Rb or NRb. Wait, actually, the correct phrasing is "Rb_NRB" with an underscore for emphasis. So in this case, since there's no other variation, I should set both rb and nrb to "Rb". But wait, the user wants only "Rb" or "NRB", no variations. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Looking at the instruction: "Do not add explanations, do not add escapes, do not use underscores, also do not add any commentary only output with JSON." So for this row, placement on device is Rb, and availability seems fine.

Moving to the second row: The company name is missing. It mentions "CoC", which is Cooca. I'll note that down. Also, "placement on device" is Bottom, so Rb or NRb? Since it's Bottom, maybe both are possible here, but perhaps set both to "Rb". The availability is "Available".

Third row: Company name is missing again. It says "Nestle" and placement on device is Full Seen. So I'll infer both rb and nrb to "NRB".

Fourth row: Company is Red Bull, location "Chennai", start time is blank. From the text, it's midnight Red Bull ad, 45 minutes long. So start_time should be 12 PM. Also, placement on device is Full Screen. Since no other data given about placement, perhaps set both rb and nrb to "Rb".

Fifth row: Company is Pantene, location "Delhi", end time blank. The description says "Pantene Hairfall ad" scheduled at 4 PM to 6:15 PM. So start_time should be 04:00 PM and end_time is 06:15 PM.

Looking through all rows, I notice that several company names are missing. Some have partially filled data or no mentions of location except for one where location is "Chennai". For example, Bisiler in Kolkata, Kurkure in Mumbai, etc. These will need to be identified and filled in properly.

I should also make sure time fields are in the correct format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. So, any blank times need to fill this out correctly. Also, if a field is vague like " rb", I need to determine both rb and nrb to their appropriate cases.

Let me go through each row systematically:

1. AD ID: ad_id
2. COMPANY NAME: empty
3. LOCATION: "Kolkata"
4. START TIME: blank
5. END TIME: blank
6. DESCRIPTION: "Bisleri ad @ 11:45 am for 30 mins", placement on device is Top, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "Available"

7. AD ID: empty
8. COMPANY NAME: "Nestle"
9. LOCATION: "Mumbai"
10. START TIME: blank
11. END TIME: blank
12. DESCRIPTION: "Company: 'Kurkure', scheduled at 10pm sharp, 1 hour", placement on device is Side Beer, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "Available"

13. AD ID: empty
14. COMPANY NAME: "Bisleri"
15. LOCATION: "Kolkata"
16. START TIME: blank
17. END TIME: blank
18. DESCRIPTION: "Bisleri ad @ 11:45 am for 30 mins", placement on device is Top, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "Available"

19. AD ID: empty
20. COMPANY NAME: "Red Bull"
21. LOCATION: "Chennai"
22. START TIME: blank
23. END TIME: blank
24. DESCRIPTION: "Midnight Red Bull ad - duration 45 mins", placement on device is Full Screen, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "Available"

25. AD ID: empty
26. COMPANY NAME: "Red Bull"
27. LOCATION: "Chennai"
28. START TIME: blank
29. END TIME: blank
30. DESCRIPTION: "Pantene Hairfall ad", placement on device is Center, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "vailble" (capitalized?)

Wait, the original row had "v Trails" but in the corrected version it's "v Trails". Hmm, maybe that was a typo.

Looking back at the user's example, in the last row under "Description": "Pantene Hairfall ad", placement on device is Center, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "v Trails".

Wait, perhaps the name has a typo. It says "Pantene Hairfall ad" but it should be "Pantene Hair Growth ad". I'll need to check that.

Also, in the original data, some times have AM/PM formatting like "3 PM" and "1:45 PM", others are midnight ("midnight Red Bull ad"). I think I can handle both cases by adding "am" or "pm" accordingly. For example, 04:00 PM is 4 PM, 12 PM is noon.

I should also ensure that all times are in the correct format without any extra characters like hyphens or slashes. So 04:00 PM becomes "04:00 PM".

Wait, looking at row #9: location is Mumbai and end time is blank. From the description, it's 1 hour. But wait, the placement on device is Full Screen? Or is it "Mumbai" but the exact text says "1 hour". Hmm.

Looking back to the initial data, row #9 has:

"Company name: 'Nestle', location: 'Mumbai'", and description: "1 hour", placement on device: Full Screen.

So I should adjust that. It's a bit unclear without seeing all details, but I think it's 1 hour. So start_time blank is correct? Or maybe 09:00 AM?

Wait, the user had an example where in row #5, "4 PM to 6:15 PM", so they used colons.

I need to ensure that times are formatted correctly with colons and AM/PM as needed. Also, I should correct any typos in names like "Kurkure" which might be a misspelling of "Kurkure" or "Bisleri".

Also, for company names that have hyphens, like " Kurkure", perhaps the text could refer to different regions? But without more context, it's hard. I'll proceed with what is given.

Finally, I should correct any typos in names and times such as changing "v Trails" to "v Trails" (capitalized as per original), but wait, no: in the last row under description, it was written as "Pantene Hairfall ad". Let me check that again.

In the original data:

Row 30 has:

AD ID: empty
 COMPANY NAME: empty
LOCATION: empty
START TIME: blank
END TIME: blank
DESCRIPTION: "Pantene Hairfall ad", placement on device is Center, rb and nrb both "Rb", availability "v Trails"

Wait, in the corrected version, it's "Pantene Hair Growth ad". So that was a typo. I'll need to fix that.

In summary:

1. Identify all missing company names.
2. For each company name, determine its location from context or text.
3. Fill in start and end times where available, converting AM/PM to 12-hour format with colons as needed.
4. If a place is not specified (like "Kolkata"), fill that in based on the text.
5. Correct any typos in company names like "Bisleri" should be "Bisi勒".
6. Ensure all time fields are in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

Now, after carefully addressing each of these points, I can start correcting each row accordingly.

Here is the corrected table with all company names identified and details filled in appropriately:
